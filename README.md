# Petit projet PHP :fire: :smiley:

This is my first PHP project, achieved with few resources, to test operations with controllers, `AltoRouter`, models and views.

## Contains :

- classes
- heritage
- routes
- _Controllers_
- _Views_
- _Models_
- ...

It has been made with PHP 7.4.9 :muscle:

## Subjet : Sonic :tada:

> This little site is about the cartoon character  **Sonic**, and it consists in 2 pages :

- 1 homepage with full range of **Sonic** characters, classed by alphabetic order,
- 1 page containing the 3 firsts **Sonic** video game creators


### Database

The small database is provided in the file `docs/sonic.sql` included in the foalder.

:warning: tablenames are keywords about SQL langage. To avoid issues, i've surrounded the name with backtick `` ` ``
Exeaple : ``SELECT * FROM `matable` ``

> An exception for datas needed in the project : datas about the 3 creators of **Sonic** can be founded here :
 - [Hirokazu Yasuhara](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Yasuhara)
 - [Yuji Naka](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Naka)
 - [Naoto ÅŒshima](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_%C5%8Cshima)



### Bonus

- I planned improve display with CSS as soon as possible !
- In the next few weeks, i hope add some others pages to let explain my creativity :bulb:
